I'm a recovering [Big Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firms) 
consultant turned software developer. I primarily work in
JavaScript and Python, though I have experience with Java as well. I am a security
expert and enthusiast, and, after several years of consulting, I am eager to
apply my knowledge in a new way and help build secure products. You can see my projects
on [GitHub](https://github.com/jongrim).
