I'm a recovering [Big Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firms) 
consultant turned software developer. 

As a consultant, I worked in cybersecurity and served as the technical engineer for product implementations. Now, I'm excited to be learning how those products are engineered and built, and I'm eager to apply my security expertise in a new way.

My go to languages are JavaScript and Python, and over the coming months I'll be learning some of the most modern tools and frameworks including Node.js, React, MongoDB, and Express.js.

You can check out my projects [on the projects page](/projects/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/jongrim).
