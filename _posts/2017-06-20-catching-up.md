It's been a busy past few weeks. In that time I've:

- Completed the [Udactity Object Oriented JavaScript course](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015)
- Completed the Advanced JavaScript course by Kyle Simpson on [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com)
- Finished several more homework assignments for the bootcamp including a [Gif search portal](https://jongrim.github.io/giphy), [Rock Paper Scissors game using Firebase](https://jongrim.github.io/realtime-RPS), and a [trivia game](https://jongrim.github.io/trivia-game).
- Dabbled in a lot of other things because I sometimes get distracted, oops.

I'm also currently in the middle of the first group project which is coming along nicely. We're building a pretty straightforward event search site using the Ticketmaster API and displaying results with Google Maps where reasonable. My only complaint is that I think the group project has turned into a 'Jon' project. I had no goal to take over, but I've produced far more code than anyone else, and seem to be the most motivated to add features and improve the application. It doesn't help that two of the team members are not searching for a development job, so they have no real incentive to make the project stand out. In fact one flat out said he would not help outside of class.

But time presses on, and the reality is that I **do** care, and I am going to keep working because it's what I enjoy and because I'm motivated.

I'm hoping to write some more technical posts soon. I struggle with my lack of a writing process because right now I've written every piece by simply sitting down and word vomitting until something that looks like a reasonable post comes out. A couple things I've been studying that could be interesting are:

- Prototypes and how they *do not* implement classical inheritance (so we should maybe cool it with the whole Class thing)
- Pub Sub design pattern. I've been using this on the group project and it is *amazing*

Also, I'm now on a 52 day streak of continuous coding and making commits to GitHub, so that's pretty cool. I think I'll aim for 100.
