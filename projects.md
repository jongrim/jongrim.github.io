Below is a list of projects I am currently working on or have completed. Links are provided to view a more detailed project page which includes info on the project, source code snippets, and of course links to the full source code and a live version of the application if available. This list is updated regularly so check back often!

### [Whats-the-Weather](/projects/whats-the-weather)
I got tired of having to open a browser and search for the weather, so I wrote a command line tool to allow me to do it from there using the OpenWeatherMap API. Check out the **[project page](projects/whats-the-weather)** or the **[source code](https://github.com/jongrim/whats-the-weather)**.

### [WarGames Hangman](/projects/wargames-hangman)
A WarGames themed Hangman game. Be sure to check out the [source code](https://github.jongrim/wargames-hangman) because you really have to see how the modules are written to apppreciate the object-oriented approach here. You can also view the **[project page](projects/wargames-hangman)** or **[play the game](https://jongrim.github.io/wargames-hangman)**.

### [The Portfolio Variety Hour](/projects/portfolios)
A collection of portfolios done using various tools including responsive layouts and Bootstrap. View the **[project page](/projects/portfolios)** or **[view them live](https://jongrim.github.io/Basic-Portfolio)** (you can toggle between the various portfolios from the live version).

### [Simple To-Do](/projects/simple-todo)
A simple, and easy to use, to-do app that remembers your items across sessions! View the **[project page](/projects/simple-todo)**, the **[source code](https://github.com/jongrim/simple-todo)**, or **[view it live](https://jongrim.github.io/simple-todo)**.

### [Meanie-Genie](/projects/meanie-genie)
 A mini-puzzle that forces clever thinking to solve. View the **[project page](/projects/meanie-genie)**, the **[source code](https://github.com/jongrim/meanie-genie)**, or **[play the game](https://jongrim.github.io/meanie-genie)**.

### [Vigenère Cipher](/projects/vigenere-cipher)
 One of the first things I wrote when I started learning Python in late 2016, and working on this project is part of what got me addicted to coding! The [Vigenère Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) is a classic algorithm for encrypting information using polyalphabetic substitution. View the **[project page](/projects/vigenere-cipher)** and the **[source code](https://github.com/jongrim/VigenereCipher)**
