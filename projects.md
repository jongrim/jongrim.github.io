### [Meanie-Genie](/projects/meanie-genie)

### [Vigenère Cipher](/projects/vigenere-cipher)
 One of the first things I wrote when I started learning Python in late 2016, and working on this project is part of what got me addicted to coding! The [Vigenère Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) is a classic algorithm for encrypting information using polyalphabetic substitution.
