The culmination of the first two weeks at the code camp was more portfolio sites than I thought I would ever need. We ended up creating three varieties, a 'basic', a responsive (without using a framework like Bootstrap), and then one using Bootstrap. Because I really view them as one large project, and because I didn't want to write three separate portfolio project pages, I tied them together both logically and literally. I added a dropdown to each site so that you can toggle between them and see the differences. The basic and the responsive look identical initially on a big screen, but you'll see that the differences come from the media queries that the responsive uses to make mobile specific layouts.

Here are the various site links:
- [Basic portfolio](https://jongrim.github.io/Basic-Portfolio)
- [Responsive portfolio](https://jongrim.github.io/responsive-portfolio)
- [Bootstrap portfolio](https://jongrim.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio)

### Project code
- [Basic portfolio](https://github.com/jongrim/Basic-Portfolio)
- [Responsive portfolio](https://github.com/jongrim/responsive-ortfolio)
- [Bootstrap portfolio](https://github.com/jongrim/bootstrap-portfolio)

### Languages
- Just a straightforward HTML website with some CSS on top (and a dash of JavaScript for Bootstrap).

### Final notes
I found that I enjoyed working with Bootstrap less this time than when I first discovered it in college. It's still great for making a quick, nice looking site, but I can see where if you want things very customized then the rails it puts up could become a pain. Still a great tool, you just need to know what you're getting into.
