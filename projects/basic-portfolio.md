The first homework assignment of the bootcamp! It makes sense that they have students start by making a portfolio, but seeing as I already have a site, and I'm quite happy with it, I decided to just post this as a project, rather than completely switching over to it. We were given a particular template to work off of, so I adhered to that. I also normally like flexbox, but I decided that I would build this with inline-blocks to get more experience with that.

View the site [here](https://jongrim.github.io/Basic-Portfolio).

### Project code
[GitHub](https://github.com/jongrim/Basic-Portfolio)

### Languages
- Just a straightforward HTML website with some CSS on top.

### Final notes
It's a good looking site if you ask me ;)
